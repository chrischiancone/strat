## Feature Requirements References

- FR-004: Initiative Budgets
- FR-006: Dashboard & Reporting (Finance Dashboard)
- FR-007: User Roles & Permissions (Finance role)
- FR-008: Comments & Collaboration

---

## Technical Considerations

**Authorization:**
- Finance role must have read access to all initiative budgets (RLS)
- Finance can comment but not edit budgets
- Optional: Finance can "validate" budgets (status field)

**Performance:**
- City-wide budget aggregations may be expensive
- Queries must be optimized with proper indexes
- Consider caching for dashboard data

**Data Integrity:**
- Ensure initiative_budgets table stays in sync with initiative financial_analysis JSONB
- Validate funding sources sum to total budget

---

## Definition of Done

**Epic is complete when:**

- [ ] All 8 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Finance can view all initiative budgets across departments
- [ ] Finance can comment on budgets and provide feedback
- [ ] Finance can track funding sources city-wide
- [ ] Finance can view grant-funded initiatives
- [ ] Finance can export budget data to Excel
- [ ] RLS policies enforce Finance permissions correctly
- [ ] Dashboard queries perform well (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Unit and integration tests complete
- [ ] Accepted by Product Owner in UAT

---

## Dependencies & Risks

**Dependencies:**
- Epic 1 complete (initiative budgets exist)
- Epic 2 comment system implemented
- RLS policies configured for Finance role

**Risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Budget data inconsistent between JSONB and normalized tables | Medium | High | Implement transaction updates, validation checks |
| Finance workflow preferences unclear | Medium | Medium | Early UAT with Finance Director, iterate on feedback |
| Dashboard queries slow | Medium | Medium | Optimize queries, add indexes, caching |

---

## Notes

- This epic is critical for Finance buy-in and budget accuracy
- Prioritize Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 first (viewing, commenting, funding tracking)
- Grant tracking (3.5) and category analysis (3.6) are important but lower priority
- Budget validation workflow (3.7) is optional - may be over-engineering for MVP
- Excel export (3.8) is valuable for Finance but could be Phase 2 if time-constrained
