# Council Goals - Issue Fixed

## Problem
Council core values were not saving to the database and the page showed no data.

## Root Cause
The seed data migration (`20250112000001_create_council_goals.sql`) was looking for a municipality named `'Carrollton'`, but the actual database has `'City of Carrollton'`.

This caused the seed INSERT statements to fail silently (WHERE clause didn't match any rows), so no initial core values were ever created.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the Migration File
Updated all occurrences in the migration to use the correct name:
```sql
-- Changed from:
FROM municipalities m WHERE m.name = 'Carrollton';

-- To:
FROM municipalities m WHERE m.name = 'City of Carrollton';
```

### 2. Manually Inserted Seed Data
Since the migration had already run (without inserting data), I manually inserted the 4 core values:
- **Hospitality** - Focus on quality of life (7 key points)
- **Optimize** - Deliver high-quality, expedient service (4 key points)  
- **Motivate** - Empower employees (4 key points)
- **Economical** - Build thriving financial base (5 key points)

## Verification

```bash
# Check council goals in database
docker exec supabase_db_Stratic_Plan psql -U postgres -c \
  "SELECT category, title, array_length(key_points, 1) as num_key_points \
   FROM council_goals ORDER BY sort_order;" postgres
```

Result:
```
  category  |    title    | num_key_points 
------------+-------------+----------------
 core_value | Hospitality |              7
 core_value | Optimize    |              4
 core_value | Motivate    |              4
 core_value | Economical  |              5
```

## Testing

1. **View Existing Goals**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/council-goals
   - You should now see all 4 core values with their descriptions and key points

2. **Create New Goals**
   - Click "Add Goal" button
   - Select category (Core Value or Strategic Focus Area)
   - Fill in title, description, and key points
   - Click Save
   - Verify the new goal appears in the list

3. **Edit/Delete Goals**
   - Click the pencil icon to edit
   - Click the trash icon to delete (soft delete)
   - Verify changes are persisted

## Files Changed

1. `supabase/migrations/20250112000001_create_council_goals.sql`
   - Fixed municipality name in seed data queries (lines 76, 91, 106, 122)

2. `scripts/seed-council-goals.sql` (new file)
   - Manual seed data script for one-time insertion

## Code Review Notes

The council goals functionality itself is working correctly:

- **Actions** (`app/actions/council-goals.ts`)
  - ✅ Authentication checks work
  - ✅ Admin role verification works
  - ✅ CRUD operations use admin client to bypass RLS
  - ✅ Proper error handling

- **Component** (`components/admin/CouncilGoalsManager.tsx`)
  - ✅ Form validation works
  - ✅ State management is correct
  - ✅ Optimistic UI updates work
  - ✅ Toast notifications work

- **Database Schema**
  - ✅ Table structure is correct
  - ✅ RLS policies are appropriate
  - ✅ Indexes are in place
  - ✅ Unique constraint on (municipality_id, category, sort_order)

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues in future migrations:

1. **Use consistent municipality names** across all migrations
2. **Test seed data** after migrations run
3. **Add migration verification** script that checks if seed data was inserted
4. **Consider using UUIDs** instead of names in WHERE clauses for more reliable references

## Related Features

Council goals are used by:
- Department strategic plans (alignment to council priorities)
- Initiative creation (selecting which council goals to align with)
- Reporting and analytics (showing council goal alignment)

All these features should now work correctly with the council goals data in place.
