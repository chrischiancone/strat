## FAQs and Troubleshooting

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### General Questions

**Q: Who can see my strategic plan?**

A: By default, your plan is visible to:
- Users in your department (all roles)
- City Manager and Finance Director
- System Administrators

You can invite additional collaborators as needed.

**Q: Can I delete a plan?**

A: Only system administrators can delete plans. Contact your admin if you need to remove a plan. Generally, plans should be archived rather than deleted for audit purposes.

**Q: How often is data backed up?**

A: The system performs automatic backups nightly. Your data is also auto-saved every 30 seconds while editing.

**Q: Can I work on a plan offline?**

A: No, the system requires an internet connection. However, you can export your plan to PDF for offline viewing.

#### Strategic Planning Questions

**Q: How many initiatives should I include in my plan?**

A: Most departments have 5-15 initiatives per 3-year plan. Focus on quality over quantity. Each initiative should be substantial (>$10K budget or >100 hours effort).

**Q: What's the difference between goals and initiatives?**

A:
- **Goals** are strategic outcomes (3-5 per plan)
- **Initiatives** are specific projects or investments that achieve goals (multiple per goal)

**Q: How do I prioritize initiatives?**

A: Use the three-tier system:
- **NEED**: Critical for basic operations or compliance
- **WANT**: Significant improvement, highly valuable
- **NICE TO HAVE**: Desirable but not essential

Within each tier, rank initiatives 1, 2, 3, etc.

**Q: What if my budget changes during the fiscal year?**

A: You can update budget amounts at any time. Major changes should be documented in comments. Finance Director should be notified of significant budget revisions.

#### Budget Questions

**Q: What if my funding sources don't match the total budget?**

A: The system requires funding sources to equal the total budget. If you have unfunded amounts, add a funding source with:
- Name: "To Be Determined" or "Unfunded"
- Status: "Requested" or "Pending"

**Q: Can one initiative have multiple funding sources?**

A: Yes! Click **Add Funding Source** multiple times. This is common for initiatives with:
- Partial grant funding + general fund match
- Bond funding + fees
- Multiple grants

**Q: How do I track grant-funded initiatives?**

A:
1. Add funding source with name of the grant
2. Set status: Secured, Requested, or Pending
3. Finance can filter by grant-funded initiatives in their dashboard
