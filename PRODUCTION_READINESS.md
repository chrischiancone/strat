## Pre-Deployment Validation

Run this script to automatically validate your configuration:

```bash
./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh
```

This script checks:
- System requirements
- Environment configuration
- Security settings
- Required files
- Dependencies
- Build success
- Code quality
- Docker configuration
- Database migrations
- Git status

---

## Deployment Commands

### Initial Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /opt/strategic-plan

# Run pre-deployment checks
./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh

# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --build

# Watch logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f

# Run database migrations
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec app npm run db:migrate

# Verify health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

### Updates and Maintenance

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --build

# Check status
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
```

## Production Best Practices

### Security
1. **Never** commit secrets to version control
2. Rotate secrets every 90 days
3. Use strong passwords (32+ characters)
4. Enable 2FA for all admin accounts
5. Monitor failed login attempts
6. Keep dependencies updated
7. Regular security audits

### Performance
1. Enable Redis caching
2. Use CDN for static assets (optional)
3. Enable Nginx compression
4. Monitor slow database queries
5. Set up database indexes
6. Configure connection pooling

### Reliability
1. Daily backups with off-site storage
2. Test restore procedures quarterly
3. Monitor uptime (target: 99.9%+)
4. Set up redundancy for critical services
5. Document all procedures
6. Regular disaster recovery drills

### Operations
1. Monitor logs daily
2. Review metrics weekly
3. Update dependencies monthly
4. Test backups monthly
5. Rotate SSL certificates before expiry
6. Document all changes
7. Maintain runbooks

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Container won't start
**Solution**: Check logs with `docker compose logs <service>`, verify environment variables

### Issue: Database connection failed
**Solution**: Verify PostgreSQL is running, check connection string, ensure migrations ran

### Issue: SSL certificate error
**Solution**: Verify certificates in `./ssl/` directory, check permissions (600), verify domain matches

### Issue: High memory usage
**Solution**: Check for memory leaks in logs, restart services, consider increasing server resources

### Issue: Slow response times
**Solution**: Check database query performance, verify Redis is working, check server resources

- Review troubleshooting guide
- Search GitHub issues

### Level 2: Team Support
- Contact development team
- Check monitoring dashboards
- Review recent changes
