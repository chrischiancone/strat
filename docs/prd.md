## Problem Statement

### Current State (As-Is)

Municipal strategic planning today relies on:

**Manual Document Creation:**
- Department Directors create strategic plans in Word/Excel
- 1,400+ line template must be manually filled
- Copy/paste from previous years with manual updates
- Version control via email attachments ("Plan_v3_final_FINAL.docx")

**Fragmented Data:**
- Budget data in spreadsheets
- KPIs tracked in separate systems
- Dependencies documented in text, not enforced
- No central repository for all department plans

**Limited Collaboration:**
- Plans reviewed via email attachments
- Comments in Word tracked changes or PDF annotations
- No visibility into other departments' plans during creation
- Cross-departmental initiatives coordinated via meetings

**Reporting Challenges:**
- City Manager must manually consolidate data from multiple plans
- Finance department recreates budget summaries from Word tables
- Council presentations require custom slide decks
- Progress tracking requires manual status updates

### Problems to Solve

**P1 - Critical Problems (Must Solve in MVP):**

1. **Plan Creation is Time-Consuming:** Directors spend 40-60 hours over 6 weeks creating plans manually
2. **Budget Data is Inconsistent:** Different departments use different formats for financial analysis
3. **No Single Source of Truth:** Plans exist as static documents, not living data
4. **Limited Visibility:** City leadership can't see real-time plan status or consolidated budgets
5. **Poor Version Control:** Unclear which document version is authoritative

**P2 - Important Problems (Post-MVP):**

6. **Difficult to Track Progress:** No structured way to monitor quarterly milestones
7. **Collaboration is Asynchronous:** Feedback loops are slow (days to weeks)
8. **Citizens Have Limited Access:** Plans published as PDFs on website, hard to navigate
9. **No Historical Analysis:** Can't easily compare year-over-year or track initiative success rates

**P3 - Nice-to-Have Problems (Future):**

10. **Duplicate Efforts:** Departments may propose similar initiatives without knowing
11. **Best Practices Not Shared:** Successful initiative patterns not surfaced
12. **Benchmarking is Manual:** Comparing to other cities requires external research
