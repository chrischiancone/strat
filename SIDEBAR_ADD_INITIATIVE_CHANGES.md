# Add Initiative Sidebar Implementation

## Overview
Successfully moved the "Add Initiative" functionality from individual plan pages to a global sidebar navigation item, making it more accessible and providing a unified entry point for initiative creation.

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Added "Add Initiative" to Sidebar Navigation
**File:** `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `Plus` icon import from lucide-react
- Added new navigation item to `mainNavigation` array:
  ```typescript
  { name: 'Add Initiative', href: '/initiatives/new', icon: Plus, roles: ['admin', 'city_manager', 'department_director'] }
  ```
- **Access Control:** Limited to users with appropriate permissions (admin, city_manager, department_director)
- **Placement:** Added under the "Main" navigation section alongside Dashboard and Strategic Plans

### ✅ 2. Created General Add Initiative Page
**File:** `app/(dashboard)/initiatives/new/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Authentication:** Verifies user login and permissions
- **Role-Based Access:** Only allows admin, city_manager, or department_director roles
- **Plan Selection:** Users can choose from all their accessible strategic plans
- **Empty State Handling:** Shows helpful message when no plans exist
- **Data Loading:** Fetches user's plans and fiscal years
- **Navigation:** Proper breadcrumb navigation back to dashboard

### ✅ 3. Created GeneralAddInitiativeForm Component
