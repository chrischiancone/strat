## Best Practices

### Strategic Planning
- **Focus on quality over quantity**: 5-15 initiatives is typical
- **Align with city priorities**: Show how your goals support city-wide objectives
- **Be specific**: Vague initiatives are hard to execute and measure
- **Involve your team**: Get input from division managers and staff
- **Start early**: Don't wait until the deadline

### Budget Planning
- **Be realistic**: Don't low-ball estimates
- **Document assumptions**: Explain how you calculated costs
- **Identify funding gaps early**: Don't assume funding will materialize
- **Include ongoing costs**: Don't forget Year 2 and Year 3 expenses
- **Plan for contingencies**: Add 10-15% buffer for unknowns

### KPI Tracking
- **Choose meaningful metrics**: Measure what matters
- **Keep it simple**: Don't track too many KPIs
- **Ensure data is collectible**: Can you actually measure this?
- **Set realistic targets**: Challenge yourself but don't set impossible goals
- **Review regularly**: Check KPI progress quarterly

### Collaboration
- **Communicate early and often**: Don't surprise reviewers
- **Respond to feedback promptly**: Don't let plans sit in limbo
- **Use @mentions**: Tag people who need to see comments
- **Document decisions**: Record why you made choices
- **Keep stakeholders informed**: Send updates on progress
