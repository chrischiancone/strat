## Testing Notes

**Test Scenarios:**
1. ✅ Dashboard displays for Finance Director
2. ✅ Dashboard displays for Admin
3. ✅ Non-Finance users cannot access (404)
4. ✅ Summary cards show accurate totals
5. ✅ Table displays all 10 columns correctly
6. ✅ Filter by single fiscal year works
7. ✅ Filter by multiple departments works
8. ✅ Filter by priority levels works
9. ✅ Filter by funding sources works
10. ✅ Search by initiative name works
11. ✅ Sorting by total cost works (asc/desc)
12. ✅ Sorting by department works
13. ✅ Pagination navigates correctly
14. ✅ "View" link navigates to initiative detail
15. ✅ All currency formatted correctly
16. ✅ Color-coded badges display properly

**Performance:**
- Dashboard loads in < 3 seconds with 100+ initiatives
- Filtering updates in < 1 second
- Pagination is instant
- Sorting is instant

**Edge Cases:**
- Empty state when no initiatives match filters
- Single page when < 50 initiatives
- Very long initiative names truncate properly
- Many funding sources show "+N" indicator

## Technical Decisions

**Pagination: Server-side, 50 items per page**
- Reason: Performance with large datasets (could be 500+ initiatives)
- Alternative: Client-side pagination (rejected: memory issues with large data)

**Sorting: Client-side for displayed page**
- Reason: Instant feedback, simpler implementation
- Note: Sorting applies only to current page (50 items)
- Future: Could move to server-side for true global sort

**Filtering: Hybrid (some server, some client)**
- Department/fiscal year: Client-side filtering after fetch
- Search: Server-side filtering
- Reason: Balance between performance and flexibility

**Access Control: Finance + Admin only**
- Reason: Budget data is sensitive, Finance role is primary validator
- Admin included for system management and support
- Department Directors view their own budgets (different route)

**Data Refresh: On filter change**
- Reason: Always show most up-to-date data
- Future: Could add manual refresh button or auto-refresh interval

## Security Considerations

**RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- Finance can view all initiative budgets
CREATE POLICY "finance_view_all_budgets" ON initiatives
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT id FROM users
      WHERE role IN ('finance', 'admin')
    )
  );
```

**Access Enforcement:**
- Page-level: Role check in server component (404 if unauthorized)
- API-level: Role check in server action (throws error if unauthorized)
- Database-level: RLS policies prevent unauthorized queries

---

## Notes

- This is the primary landing page for Finance Director
- Provides comprehensive view of all city-wide budget commitments
- Critical for budget validation and funding source tracking
- Enables Finance to identify:
  - Over-budget initiatives
  - Unfunded initiatives
  - Funding source over-commitment
  - Budget inconsistencies

**Future Enhancements:**
- Bulk comment/flag initiatives
- Export filtered results to Excel
- Budget variance analysis (planned vs. actual)
- Historical budget comparison
- Budget approval workflow (mark budgets as "validated")
- Alert system for budget issues
- Integration with accounting systems
