## Technical Decisions

**PDF Library Choice:** @react-pdf/renderer
- Pros: React components, TypeScript support, server-side rendering
- Cons: Limited styling options vs. HTML
- Alternative considered: Puppeteer (rejected: heavier, needs Chrome)

**Data Aggregation:** Reuse existing actions
- Reason: DRY principle, consistency with dashboards

**File Delivery:** Direct download (not email)
- Reason: Immediate delivery, no email infrastructure needed
- Future: Add email option
