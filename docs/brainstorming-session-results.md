## Technique Sessions

### Technique: Structured Inquiry - 30 minutes

**Description:** Guided exploration through key architectural decision points with option presentation and collaborative evaluation

#### Ideas Generated:

1. **Data Model Approach**
   - Selected: Hybrid approach (relational core + JSONB flexibility)
   - Rationale: Core entities normalized for querying; complex nested data in JSONB
   - Benefits: Easy aggregation queries while preserving template structure flexibility

2. **Financial Data Architecture**
   - Normalized `initiative_budgets` table for aggregation
   - JSONB `financial_analysis` for detailed breakdowns
   - Dual approach enables both reporting and template compliance

3. **Multi-Municipality Support**
   - Single database with municipality scoping
   - Row-level security filters by municipality_id
   - Future-proofs for SaaS expansion

4. **Workflow & Approval Management**
   - State machine approach with defined transitions
   - Status field: draft → under_review → approved → active → archived
   - Audit log captures all state changes

5. **RAG & AI Integration**
   - pgvector extension for embeddings
   - `document_embeddings` table with 1536-dimension vectors
   - Enables semantic search, comparative analysis, Q&A

6. **Priority Tier System**
   - Enum field: NEED, WANT, NICE_TO_HAVE
   - Rank within priority for granular ordering
   - Supports funding scenario planning

7. **Cross-departmental Collaboration**
   - Junction table `initiative_collaborators`
   - Tracks role (lead, support, contributor)
   - Budget share per department

8. **Dependency Tracking**
   - Self-referencing `initiative_dependencies` table
   - Dependency types: internal, external, resource_sharing
   - Critical path flag for blocking dependencies

9. **Performance Metrics (KPIs)**
   - Flexible association: initiative, goal, or plan level
   - Baseline + Year 1/2/3 targets
   - Actual values stored in JSONB for timeline tracking

10. **Quarterly Milestones**
    - Quarter-by-quarter implementation tracking
    - Budget impact per quarter
    - Status tracking: not_started → in_progress → completed → delayed

11. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**
    - Automatic triggers on strategic plans, initiatives, budgets, goals
    - Captures old/new values, user, timestamp, IP
    - Immutable log for government accountability

12. **Collaborative Comments**
    - Threaded comments on plans, initiatives, goals, milestones
    - Resolve flag for review workflows
    - Author tracking and access control

13. **SWOT & Environmental Scan**
    - JSONB fields on strategic_plans table
    - Preserves template structure exactly
    - Easy to display as formatted sections

14. **ROI Analysis Structure**
    - Financial ROI: savings, revenue, payback period
    - Non-financial: service quality, efficiency, risk reduction, satisfaction
    - Cost-benefit breakdown for decision-making

15. **Row-level Security Design**
    - Department-scoped access by default
    - Role-based permissions (admin, director, staff, city_manager, finance, council, public)
    - Helper functions for common checks

#### Insights Discovered:
- The template's complexity (15+ major sections) requires flexible JSONB storage but relational backbone
- Financial reporting needs demand normalized budget data alongside detailed JSONB breakdowns
- Government accountability requires comprehensive audit trails and approval workflows
- Multi-year planning necessitates fiscal year as first-class entity

#### Notable Connections:
- Initiative budgets connect to both fiscal years AND funding sources (many-to-many relationship)
- KPIs can exist at three levels (initiative, goal, plan) requiring nullable FK pattern
- Dependencies create graph structure requiring careful query design to avoid cycles
- Embeddings link to multiple content types via polymorphic pattern

   - Transformative potential: Non-technical users can analyze data without training
   - Challenges to overcome: Query accuracy, ambiguity handling, complex join translation

### Insights & Learnings
**Key realizations from the session**

- **Template Complexity Drives Architecture**: The 1,400+ line Info.md template isn't just documentation—it's the product specification. JSONB fields mirror template sections exactly.

- **Government Workflows Are Unique**: Unlike SaaS apps, municipal strategic planning has formal approval chains, public transparency requirements, and multi-year budget cycles. The schema reflects these constraints.

- **Hybrid Models Are Powerful**: The combination of normalized relational tables for aggregation queries with JSONB for template fidelity gives the best of both worlds. Neither pure approach would work.

- **Security Must Be Foundational**: RLS policies defined upfront prevent security bolted-on later. Department scoping is the core access pattern.

- **AI/RAG Opens New Possibilities**: Vector embeddings enable features impossible with traditional search: "Find initiatives similar to this," comparative analysis, Q&A over plans.

- **Audit Trails Are Non-Negotiable**: Government accountability demands comprehensive change tracking. Automatic audit triggers ensure nothing is missed.

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- **Structured option presentation** helped evaluate tradeoffs systematically (hybrid vs pure relational vs pure document)
- **Real template analysis** grounded decisions in actual requirements rather than assumptions
- **Iterative schema refinement** through Q&A built confidence in design choices
- **Visual ER diagrams** in documentation clarified complex relationships

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Performance optimization**: How will queries perform with 100+ initiatives per plan? Need to test with realistic data volume
- **Migration strategy**: How to handle schema evolution once in production? Consider versioning approach
- **Backup and recovery**: What's the backup strategy for local development vs production?
- **Multi-municipality rollout**: If/when adding second city, what configuration is needed?
- **Integration points**: Will this need to integrate with existing city systems (HR, finance, GIS)?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Assumption Reversal**: Challenge core assumptions (e.g., "What if departments don't want AI assistance?")
- **Five Whys**: Dig deeper into user workflows (e.g., "Why do we need quarterly milestones vs monthly?")
- **Role Playing**: Brainstorm from different stakeholder perspectives (Department Director, City Manager, Finance, Citizen)
- **Time Shifting**: "How would requirements differ if building this in 2030 vs today?"

### Questions That Emerged
- How will the system handle mid-year plan adjustments when priorities change?
- Should there be version control for initiatives (track changes over time)?
- What's the approval process for budget amendments during implementation?
- How do we handle initiatives that span multiple goals or even multiple plans?
- Should KPI actual values be editable by anyone or restricted by role?
- What happens to historical data when a department is reorganized or renamed?
- How will we handle file attachments (PDFs, spreadsheets, images)?
- Should there be notifications/alerts when milestones are delayed?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:**
  1. Frontend architecture brainstorming (component structure, state management, forms)
  2. User workflows and UX design (plan creation wizard, dashboard layouts)
  3. AI/RAG implementation strategy (embedding pipeline, retrieval, prompts)
- **Recommended timeframe:** 1-2 weeks after initial Next.js implementation
- **Preparation needed:**
  - Build one complete feature end-to-end
  - Document pain points and questions that emerge
  - Gather user feedback on initial prototypes
