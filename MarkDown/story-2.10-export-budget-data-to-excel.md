## Technical Decisions

**Excel Library Choice:** xlsx (SheetJS)
- Pros: Pure JavaScript, no dependencies, well-maintained
- Cons: Limited styling vs. Excel-native APIs
- Alternative considered: exceljs (rejected: larger, more complex)

**Data Format:** Array of arrays (aoa_to_sheet)
- Reason: Simple, fast, flexible
- Alternative: JSON to sheet (less control over structure)

**Sheet Organization:** One topic per sheet
- Reason: Easy navigation, clear organization
- Allows users to focus on specific analysis

**File Delivery:** Direct download
- Reason: Immediate availability, no storage needed
- Future: Option to email or save to cloud storage
