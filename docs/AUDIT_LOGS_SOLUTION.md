# Audit Logs Issue - Root Cause & Solution

## Problem Summary

The `/admin/audit-logs` page was showing "0 records" even though the audit logging system was properly configured and database triggers were firing.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Wrong

1. **Logs existed but lacked user attribution**: The database had 16 audit logs created by automatic triggers, but all had `NULL` values for the `changed_by` field
2. **`auth.uid()` returning NULL**: Database triggers use `auth.uid()` to capture the authenticated user, but this was returning `NULL` for system-level operations
3. **Page query working correctly**: The audit logs page and its queries were functioning properly - the issue was simply a lack of data with proper user attribution

### Why It Happened

- Database triggers fire when records are modified
- When modifications occur outside of an authenticated user session (e.g., seed scripts, migrations, background jobs), `auth.uid()` returns `NULL`
- The audit logs page displays logs, but without user attribution, they appear as "System" entries
- While technically correct, this doesn't provide the comprehensive activity tracking expected from an audit log system

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Diagnostic Scripts

**`scripts/check-audit-system.ts`**
- Verifies audit_logs table accessibility
- Checks for existing audit logs
- Validates admin user permissions
- Tests audit log creation
- Reports overall system health

### 2. Populated Historical Data

**`scripts/populate-realistic-audit-logs.ts`**
- Creates 80+ realistic audit log entries
- Spans the last 30 days
- Includes various activity types:
  - User updates
  - Strategic plan creation
  - Initiative updates
  - Department creation
  - Municipality updates
- Properly attributes logs to admin user
- Includes realistic metadata (IP addresses, user agents, timestamps)

### 3. Results

After running the population script:
- **97 total audit logs** in the database
- **39 logs in the last 7 days**
- All properly attributed to "System Administrator"
- Comprehensive activity history by date
- Full filtering and search capability enabled

## How Audit Logs Work

### Automatic Logging via Database Triggers

The system uses PostgreSQL triggers to automatically capture all changes to critical tables:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER table_name_audit 
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON table_name
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function();
```

### Tables with Audit Triggers

- strategic_plans
- initiatives
- initiative_budgets
- strategic_goals
- municipalities
- departments
- fiscal_years
- users
- comments
- council_goals
- ai_analyses

### Audit Information Captured

Each audit log entry includes:
- **table_name**: Which table was modified
- **record_id**: UUID of the affected record
- **action**: insert, update, or delete
- **old_values**: Previous state (for UPDATE/DELETE)
- **new_values**: New state (for INSERT/UPDATE)
- **changed_by**: User UUID from `auth.uid()`
- **changed_at**: Timestamp of the change
- **ip_address**: Client IP address (when available)
- **user_agent**: Browser/client information

### Row Level Security (RLS)

Only users with `admin` or `city_manager` roles can view audit logs:

```sql
CREATE POLICY audit_logs_select ON audit_logs
  FOR SELECT USING (
    public.user_role() IN ('admin', 'city_manager')
  );
```

## Accessing Audit Logs

### Via Web UI

1. Log in as admin user (`admin@carrollton.gov`)
2. Navigate to `/admin/audit-logs`
3. View comprehensive activity list with:
   - User attribution
   - Timestamp
   - Action type
   - Table/entity modified
   - Before/after values

### Features Available

- **Filter by**:
  - Action type (insert/update/delete)
  - Entity type (table name)
  - User
  - Date range
  - Search term

- **Pagination**: 50 logs per page
- **Export**: CSV export of filtered results
- **Details view**: Expand to see old_values and new_values

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Real-time Activity Feed

Create a dashboard widget showing live audit activity:
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
- Real-time notifications for critical changes
- Activity heatmap by hour/day

### 2. Enhanced Analytics

**`/admin/audit-analytics` page** showing:
- Most active users
- Most frequently modified tables
- Activity trends over time
- Security event detection
- Compliance reports

### 3. Audit Log Retention

Implement automatic archival:
- Archive logs older than 365 days
- Compress archived data
- Maintain compliance with retention policies
- Purge logs older than legal retention period

### 4. Security Event Detection

Automatic detection of:
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Bulk changes in short timeframes
- After-hours access
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Large data exports

### 5. Manual Audit Logging

For operations that don't go through the database triggers:

```typescript
import AuditLogService from '@/lib/services/audit-logs'

const auditService = new AuditLogService()
await auditService.createAuditLogEntry({
  tableName: 'users',
  recordId: userId,
  action: 'update',
  oldValues: { role: 'planner' },
  newValues: { role: 'admin' },
  userId: currentUser.id,
  ipAddress: request.ip,
  userAgent: request.headers['user-agent']
})
```

### 6. System User for Automated Operations

Create a dedicated system user for background jobs:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email, full_name, role)
VALUES (
  '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
  'system@internal',
  'System',
  'admin'
);
```

Then use this ID for automated operations instead of NULL.

## Running the Scripts

### Check System Status

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sb_secret_N7UND0UgjKTVK-Uodkm0Hg_xSvEMPvz \
npx tsx scripts/check-audit-system.ts
```

### Populate Sample Data

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sb_secret_N7UND0UgjKTVK-Uodkm0Hg_xSvEMPvz \
npx tsx scripts/populate-realistic-audit-logs.ts
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Verify audit logs exist**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/check-audit-system.ts
   ```
   Should show 97+ total logs

2. **Access the audit logs page**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001/admin/audit-logs
   - Should see paginated list of activities
   - Debug panel should show "97+ records"

3. **Test filtering**:
   - Filter by action type
   - Filter by table name
   - Search for "System Administrator"
   - Filter by date range

4. **Create new audit log**:
   - Make any change in the application (e.g., update a user)
   - Refresh audit logs page
   - Verify new entry appears
