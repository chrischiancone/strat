## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:

1. **`/app/actions/comments.ts`** - Added resolution functions
   - `resolveComment()` - Marks comment as resolved
   - `unresolveComment()` - Reopens resolved comment
   - `getUnresolvedCommentCount()` - Counts open comments per entity

2. **`/components/comments/CommentItem.tsx`** - Added Resolve button
   - "Resolve" button for entity owners and comment authors
   - Visual indicator for resolved status (checkmark + badge)
   - Option to unresolve if needed

3. **`/components/comments/CommentsList.tsx`** - Collapse resolved
   - Resolved comments collapsed by default
   - "Show resolved comments" toggle
   - Count of resolved vs. unresolved

4. **Plan/Initiative components** - Added comment count badges
   - Unresolved comment count displayed
   - Red badge when comments need attention
   - Clicking badge scrolls to comments section

### Resolution Logic:

**Who can resolve:**
- Comment author (person who wrote it)
- Entity owner (plan/initiative creator)
- City Manager (on any comment)
- Admin (on any comment)

**Resolution applies to:**
- Single comment (not entire thread)
- Child comments inherit parent resolution state (optional)

### Visual Design:

**Unresolved Comment:**
```
â”Œâ”€ John Doe - 2 hours ago
â”‚  "Please clarify the budget for Year 2"
â”‚  [Reply] [Resolve] [Edit] [Delete]
```

**Resolved Comment (collapsed):**
```
â”Œâ”€ âœ“ John Doe - 2 hours ago [Resolved]
â”‚  "Please clarify the budget..." [Expand]
```

**Resolved Comment (expanded):**
```
â”Œâ”€ âœ“ John Doe - 2 hours ago [Resolved]
â”‚  "Please clarify the budget for Year 2"
â”‚  [Reply] [Unresolve] [Edit] [Delete]
â”‚
â”‚  â””â”€ Jane Smith - 1 hour ago
â”‚     "Updated the budget breakdown"
```

**Comment Count Badge:**
```
Initiative Title                    ðŸ’¬ 3
                                    ^unresolved
```

## Testing Notes

**Test Scenarios:**
1. âœ… Department Director can resolve comment on their plan
2. âœ… City Manager can resolve any comment
3. âœ… Resolved comment shows checkmark and badge
4. âœ… Resolved comments collapse by default
5. âœ… User can expand resolved comment to view
6. âœ… User can unresolve a resolved comment
7. âœ… Unresolved count updates correctly
8. âœ… Comment count badge displays on entity
9. âœ… Non-owners cannot resolve others' comments

**Edge Cases:**
- Resolving parent comment doesn't auto-resolve replies
- Deleting resolved comment updates count
- Zero unresolved comments hides badge

## Technical Decisions

**Resolution Scope: Per comment (not thread)**
- Reason: Allows granular tracking of which issues addressed
- Alternative: Resolve entire thread (rejected: loses granularity)

**Default State: Collapsed when resolved**
- Reason: Reduces visual clutter, focuses on open issues
- Users can still expand to view resolved discussion

**Who can resolve: Entity owners + comment authors**
- Reason: Owner knows when feedback addressed, author knows when question answered
- City Manager override: Can resolve any comment (quality control)

**Database: Boolean flag**
- `is_resolved` column on `comments` table
- Simple, fast to query
- Alternative: Separate `comment_resolutions` table (rejected: overcomplicated)

## Notes

- Resolution workflow helps track feedback lifecycle
- Critical for City Manager to see which issues are still open
- Prevents "comment clutter" as discussions grow
- Unresolved count acts as todo list for Department Directors
- Future enhancements:
  - Auto-resolve when certain actions taken (e.g., budget updated)
  - Resolution reason/note
  - Re-open resolved comments if issue resurfaces
  - Resolution statistics in reporting
  - Filter entities by "has unresolved comments"
