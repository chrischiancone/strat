# Optimization Settings Implementation

## Overview
Implemented functional optimization and monitoring settings in the Performance Settings Optimization tab. Settings are now actively applied to the application's runtime behavior, including rate limiting, compression preferences, and logging configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `/lib/performance/settings.ts`
A performance settings utility that:
- Fetches performance settings from the database
- Caches settings for 5 minutes to reduce database load
- Provides default values if settings cannot be loaded
- Exports functions to invalidate cache when settings change

### 2. Created `/lib/performance/apply-settings.ts`
Runtime settings application that:
- Applies monitoring settings to the logger (log level, error tracking)
- Can be called at app startup or when settings change
- Gracefully handles errors and falls back to defaults

### 3. Updated `middleware.ts`
Enhanced middleware to:
- Load performance settings on each request (with 5-minute cache)
- Apply **dynamic rate limiting** based on `max_concurrent_requests` setting
- Add compression header when `enable_compression` is enabled
- Use performance settings to control behavior

### 4. Updated `lib/logger.ts`
Enhanced logger with:
- `setLogLevel()` - Dynamically change log level at runtime
- `setErrorTracking()` - Enable/disable error tracking
- `getLogLevel()` - Get current log level
- `isErrorTrackingEnabled()` - Check error tracking status
- Placeholder for external error tracking integration (Sentry, DataDog, etc.)

### 5. Updated `app/actions/settings.ts`
Enhanced settings actions to:
- Invalidate performance settings cache immediately after save
- Apply monitoring settings to logger without requiring restart
- Ensure changes take effect within seconds

## Runtime Behavior

### Settings Application Flow
1. Admin saves performance settings via UI
2. `updatePerformanceSettings()` writes to database
3. Performance settings cache is invalidated
4. Monitoring settings applied immediately to logger
5. Middleware picks up new settings within 5 minutes (or immediately on next request after cache refresh)

### Cache Strategy
- Performance settings cached for 5 minutes in middleware
- Reduces database queries on every request
- Cache invalidated immediately when settings updated
- Balances performance with configuration responsiveness

### Rate Limiting Example
```typescript
// Before (hardcoded):
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW = 100

// After (dynamic from settings):
const maxRequests = perfSettings.optimization.max_concurrent_requests
// Can now be 50, 100, 200, etc. based on admin configuration
```

### Logger Configuration Example
```typescript
// When monitoring disabled:
logger.setLogLevel('error')
logger.setErrorTracking(false)

// When monitoring enabled with info level:
logger.setLogLevel('info')
logger.setErrorTracking(true)
```

- Exponential backoff for repeat offenders
- Redis-backed rate limiting for multi-server deployments

### 5. Compression Controls
- Choose compression algorithm (gzip, brotli, deflate)

- Exclude certain content types from compression
- Track compression ratios and bandwidth savings

### 6. External Error Tracking
- Integrate Sentry for error tracking
- Add Sentry DSN configuration to settings
- Automatically send errors when tracking enabled
- Link errors to user sessions and context

### 7. A/B Testing for Optimizations
- Test different optimization settings
- Measure impact on performance metrics
- Automatically choose best-performing configuration
- Show performance comparison in UI

## Notes

### Cache Considerations
- Performance settings cache refreshes every 5 minutes
- For immediate effect, restart the application
- Consider Redis for distributed cache in multi-server setup

### Compression
- Next.js handles compression automatically in production
- The setting provides visibility and control preference
- Actual compression depends on client `Accept-Encoding` header

### Rate Limiting
- Currently uses in-memory store (not shared across servers)
- For production with multiple servers, use Redis
- Rate limits reset every 15 minutes

### Monitoring
- Log level changes apply immediately when settings saved
- Consider log rotation for large deployments
- Use structured logging for better parsing in log aggregators
