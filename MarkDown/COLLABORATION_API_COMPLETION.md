- ✅ Actor tracking (who triggered the notification)
- ✅ Statistics & analytics
- ✅ Bulk mark-as-read/delete operations

### 4. **Activity Feed API** ✅ (`/api/collaboration/activity/`)

- ✅ `POST /activity` - Create activity entries
- ✅ `PUT /activity` - Get analytics

**Features:**
- ✅ Comprehensive activity tracking
- ✅ Date-based grouping
- ✅ User and resource filtering
- ✅ Activity analytics (daily breakdown, top users)
- ✅ System vs user activity separation
- ✅ Real-time activity broadcasting

### 5. **Session Management API** ✅ (`/api/collaboration/sessions/`)

**Main Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /sessions` - Get session info/participants  
- ✅ `POST /sessions` - Join/leave/create sessions
- ✅ `DELETE /sessions` - End sessions

**Actions Supported:**
- ✅ `join` - Join collaboration session
- ✅ `leave` - Leave session  
- ✅ `create` - Create new session
- ✅ `updatePresence` - Live presence updates
- ✅ `broadcastEvent` - Custom event broadcasting

### 6. **Enhanced Security** ✅

**Authentication Middleware:**
- ✅ Added collaboration API auth to existing middleware
- ✅ JWT token validation via Supabase
- ✅ User context injection (x-user-id header)
- ✅ Rate limiting for collaboration endpoints
- ✅ Department-scoped access control

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Resource permission checking
- ✅ Owner-only operations (edit/delete)
- ✅ Admin privilege escalation
- ✅ Input validation & sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection protection
