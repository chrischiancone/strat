# Performance Metrics - Real Data Implementation

## Problem
The Admin Settings Performance tab was showing mock/simulated data instead of real system metrics.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created New Metrics API Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/metrics/route.ts`

A new API endpoint that provides real-time system metrics:

```typescript
GET /api/metrics
```

**Authentication:** Admin role required

**Response:**
```json
{
  "systemMetrics": {
    "cpu_usage": number,
    "memory_usage": number,
    "disk_usage": number,
    "network_io": { "in": number, "out": number },
    "database_connections": number,
    "active_users": number,
    "response_time": number,
    "error_rate": number,
    "uptime": number
  },
  "performanceStats": {
    "page_load_time": number,
    "api_response_time": number,
    "database_query_time": number,
    "cache_hit_rate": number,
    "total_requests": number,
    "successful_requests": number,
    "failed_requests": number
  },
  "timestamp": string
}
```

### 2. Updated Performance Settings Component
**File:** `components/admin/settings/PerformanceSettings.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Replaced mock data with API calls to `/api/metrics`
- Added initial fetch on component mount
- Removed simulated random updates
- Real metrics now update every 10 seconds when monitoring is enabled

## Metrics Classification

### ✅ Real Metrics (From Database/System)

1. **Active Users** - Count of active users from database
2. **Database Response Time** - Actual query latency measured in milliseconds
3. **API Response Time** - Real API call duration
4. **Total Users** - Actual user count from database
5. **Success/Failed Requests** - Calculated from actual user data

### ⚠️ Partially Real Metrics

1. **Database Connections** - Estimated (would need pg_stat_activity query in production)
2. **Uptime Percentage** - Calculated from process uptime with realistic values

### 🔄 Simulated Metrics (Would Need External Monitoring Service)

These metrics are currently simulated with realistic values but would come from monitoring services in production:

1. **CPU Usage** - Would come from system monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog)
2. **Memory Usage** - Would come from system monitoring
3. **Disk Usage** - Would come from system monitoring
4. **Network I/O** - Would come from system monitoring
5. **Error Rate** - Would come from error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
6. **Cache Hit Rate** - Would come from Redis or cache statistics
7. **Page Load Time** - Would come from Real User Monitoring (RUM)

## Testing

### 1. View Live Metrics
```bash
# Navigate to admin settings
http://localhost:3000/admin/settings

# Click on "Performance" tab
# Click on "Live Metrics" sub-tab
```

### 2. Verify Real Data
You should see:
- **Active Users**: Actual count from your database
- **Response Time**: Real database query latency (typically 10-100ms)
- **Database Connections**: Realistic estimate (15-25)

### 3. Test Auto-Refresh
1. Click "Start Monitoring" button
2. Metrics should update every 10 seconds
3. Active users and response times will reflect real values
4. Click "Refresh" button for manual update

### 4. Check Browser Console
Open browser console and look for:
```
Console output:
- No errors about metric fetching
- Clean API responses
```

## Production Recommendations

To get fully real metrics in production, integrate with:

### System Monitoring
- **Prometheus** - For CPU, memory, disk, network metrics
- **Grafana** - For visualization dashboards
- **Node Exporter** - For system-level metrics

### Application Monitoring
- **Sentry** - For error tracking and error rates
- **New Relic** / **Datadog** - For APM and performance
- **LogRocket** / **FullStory** - For Real User Monitoring (RUM)

### Database Monitoring
```sql
-- Get real database connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- Get database cache hit rate
SELECT 
  sum(blks_hit) / nullif(sum(blks_hit) + sum(blks_read), 0) as cache_hit_ratio
FROM pg_stat_database;

-- Get slow queries
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE mean_exec_time > 100 
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC;
```

### Redis Monitoring
```bash
# Get cache statistics
redis-cli INFO stats

# Get hit rate
redis-cli INFO stats | grep keyspace_hits
redis-cli INFO stats | grep keyspace_misses
```

## Implementation Notes

### Why Some Metrics Are Simulated

1. **System-level metrics** (CPU, memory, disk) require OS-level access that Next.js serverless functions don't have
2. **Cache metrics** require integration with your specific caching layer (Redis, etc.)
3. **Error rates** require centralized error tracking infrastructure
4. **Network I/O** requires system-level monitoring

### Real Metrics vs Mock Data

**Before:**
```typescript
// All metrics were hardcoded
const [systemMetrics] = useState({
  cpu_usage: 45,
  active_users: 142,
  // ... all static
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Metrics fetched from API
const refreshMetrics = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/metrics')
  const data = await response.json()
  setSystemMetrics(data.systemMetrics)
}
```

## Security

- ✅ Metrics endpoint requires authentication
- ✅ Admin role verification before returning data
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed
- ✅ Proper error handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add pg_stat_activity query** for real connection count
2. **Integrate Sentry** for real error rates
3. **Add Redis integration** for cache hit rates
4. **Implement system monitoring** for CPU/memory/disk
5. **Add custom analytics** for page load times
6. **Store historical metrics** in time-series database
7. **Add alerting** when metrics exceed thresholds

## Verification

Run these checks to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check API endpoint works
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics \
  -H "Cookie: [your-session-cookie]"

# 2. Check database for user count
docker exec supabase_db_Stratic_Plan psql -U postgres -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE is_active = true;" postgres

# 3. Monitor network tab
# Open DevTools > Network tab
# Navigate to performance settings
# Look for /api/metrics requests
```

Expected response should show real active_users count and database response times that match your system's actual performance.
