# ADR-001: Add Comprehensive Database Indexes for Performance Optimization

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Technical Story:** Enterprise Performance Improvements

## Context and Problem Statement

The Strategic Planning application was experiencing slow query performance as the database grew. Users reported delays when loading dashboards, filtering initiatives, and generating reports. Database analysis showed missing indexes on frequently queried columns, resulting in full table scans.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for sub-second query response times on primary user workflows
* Growing database size (municipal government data accumulates over years)
* Multiple concurrent users accessing the system
* Complex queries with JOINs and WHERE clauses
* Budget/resource constraints (free/open-source preference)
* Maintenance overhead of additional indexes

## Considered Options

1. Add comprehensive indexes on all frequently queried columns
2. Use query-specific materialized views
3. Implement application-level caching only
4. Add indexes incrementally based on slow query logs

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Add comprehensive indexes on all frequently queried columns", because it provides immediate performance improvements with minimal application code changes and is a standard database optimization technique.

### Positive Consequences

* Immediate 10-100x performance improvement on filtered queries
* Reduced database CPU and I/O usage
* Better user experience with faster page loads
* Improved scalability as data grows
* Full-text search capabilities with GIN indexes
* Query planner can optimize more effectively

### Negative Consequences

* Increased database storage requirements (~10-15%)
* Slightly slower INSERT/UPDATE operations
* Need to maintain indexes during schema changes
* Periodic VACUUM and ANALYZE required for PostgreSQL

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Add comprehensive indexes

* Good, because provides immediate performance gains
* Good, because standard database optimization practice
* Good, because minimal code changes required
* Good, because PostgreSQL handles indexes efficiently
* Bad, because increases storage requirements
* Bad, because slower write operations

### Use query-specific materialized views

* Good, because can dramatically speed up specific complex queries
* Good, because pre-computed results
* Bad, because requires refresh strategy (adds complexity)
* Bad, because data staleness issues
* Bad, because harder to maintain as queries change

### Implement application-level caching only

* Good, because reduces database load
* Good, because can cache computed results
* Bad, because doesn't solve underlying query performance
* Bad, because cache invalidation complexity
* Bad, because cold cache still slow

### Add indexes incrementally

* Good, because focused optimization
* Good, because can measure each improvement
* Bad, because piecemeal approach takes longer
* Bad, because users suffer slow queries during phased rollout
* Bad, because requires extensive monitoring infrastructure

## Implementation Details

### Index Strategy

1. **Single-column indexes** on:
   - Foreign keys (for JOINs)
   - Status fields (for filtering)
   - Date fields (for time-based queries)
   - Boolean flags (for conditional queries)

2. **Composite indexes** on:
   - Common filter combinations (e.g., department_id + status)
   - Covering indexes for frequent queries

3. **GIN indexes** on:
   - Full-text search fields (names, descriptions)

4. **Partial indexes** on:
   - Unread notifications (WHERE is_read = false)

### Monitoring

* Query performance tracked via application logs
* Database query statistics monitored
* Index usage tracked with pg_stat_user_indexes
* Unused indexes identified and removed
