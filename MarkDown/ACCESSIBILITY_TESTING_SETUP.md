# Accessibility Testing Setup - Complete! ✅

## Overview

We've successfully implemented comprehensive automated accessibility testing using **axe-core** and **Playwright** to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across the Strategic Planning System.

## What Was Installed

### Dependencies
```bash
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/playwright axe-core
```

**Packages Added:**
- `@axe-core/playwright` v4.10.2 - Playwright integration for axe-core
- `axe-core` v4.11.0 - Core accessibility testing engine

## What Was Created

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite

**Location:** `tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ **8 Test Suites** with 20+ individual tests
- ✅ **Public Pages**: Login, Signup
- ✅ **Dashboard Pages**: Main dashboard, Plans, Finance
- ✅ **Admin Pages**: Admin dashboard, Users, Departments, Audit logs, Settings
- ✅ **Component Tests**: Forms, Buttons, Navigation
- ✅ **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and focus
- ✅ **Screen Reader Support**: Alt text, headings, landmarks
- ✅ **Form Accessibility**: Labels, required fields, error messages

### 2. NPM Scripts

Added to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:a11y": "playwright test tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts",
    "test:a11y:ui": "playwright test tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts --ui",
    "test:a11y:headed": "playwright test tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts --headed"
  }
}
```

### 3. Complete Documentation

**Location:** `docs/ACCESSIBILITY_TESTING.md`

**Includes:**
- Getting started guide
- How to run tests (3 different modes)
- Understanding test results and violations
- Common violations and how to fix them
- Best practices for accessible development
- CI/CD integration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Resource links

## How to Use

### Quick Start

**Run all accessibility tests:**
```bash
npm run test:a11y
```

**Run with interactive UI (recommended):**
```bash
npm run test:a11y:ui
```

**Run in headed mode (see browser):**
```bash
npm run test:a11y:headed
```

### Test Specific Pages

```bash
# Test only login page
npx playwright test -g "login page"

# Test only admin pages
npx playwright test -g "Admin Pages"

# Test form accessibility
npx playwright test -g "Form Accessibility"
```

## What Gets Tested

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

The test suite automatically checks for:

1. **Color Contrast** (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - ✅ Text vs background contrast
   - ✅ Button and link contrast
   - ✅ Gray color palette compliance

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - ✅ All interactive elements reachable by Tab
   - ✅ Proper focus order
   - ✅ Visible focus indicators
   - ✅ Keyboard-only functionality

3. **Form Accessibility**
   - ✅ All inputs have associated labels
   - ✅ Required fields properly marked
   - ✅ Error messages linked to inputs
   - ✅ ARIA attributes when needed

4. **Screen Reader Support**
   - ✅ Images have alt text
   - ✅ Proper heading structure (h1, h2, h3...)
   - ✅ Landmark regions (header, nav, main, footer)
   - ✅ ARIA labels on interactive elements

5. **Semantic HTML**
   - ✅ Proper use of buttons vs links
   - ✅ Form elements properly structured
   - ✅ Lists properly marked up

## Example Test Output

### Passing Test
```bash
✅ Public Pages › login page should not have accessibility violations (1.2s)
```

### Failing Test with Details
```bash
❌ Dashboard › dashboard should not have accessibility violations (0.8s)

Expected: []
Received: [
  {
    "id": "color-contrast",
    "impact": "serious",
    "description": "Elements must have sufficient color contrast",
    "help": "Ensure sufficient color contrast",
    "helpUrl": "https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/color-contrast",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "html": "<p class=\"text-gray-400\">...",
        "target": [".text-gray-400"],
        "failureSummary": "Fix: Increase contrast to 4.5:1"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)

Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Run Accessibility Tests
  run: npm run test:a11y

- name: Upload Accessibility Report
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: accessibility-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

This will:
- Run accessibility tests on every PR
- Upload detailed reports if tests fail
- Block merges if critical violations found

### Pre-commit Hook (Optional)

Add to `.husky/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```

## Common Violations and Quick Fixes

### 1. Color Contrast
```tsx
// ❌ Before (insufficient contrast)
<p className="text-gray-400">Text</p>

// ✅ After (sufficient contrast)
<p className="text-gray-700">Text</p>
```

### 2. Missing Form Labels
```tsx
// ❌ Before
<input type="email" placeholder="Email" />

// ✅ After
<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<input id="email" type="email" />
```

### 3. Missing Alt Text
```tsx
// ❌ Before
<img src="/logo.png" />

// ✅ After
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Company logo" />
```

### 4. Missing ARIA Labels on Icons
```tsx
// ❌ Before
<button>
  <TrashIcon />
</button>

// ✅ After
<button aria-label="Delete user">
  <TrashIcon />
</button>
```

## Test Results Interpretation

### Severity Levels

1. **🔴 Critical** - Must fix immediately (blocks basic functionality)
2. **🟠 Serious** - Should fix soon (significantly impacts users)
3. **🟡 Moderate** - Fix when possible (causes inconvenience)
4. **🟢 Minor** - Enhancement (minimal impact)

### Success Criteria

- ✅ **0 Critical violations** - Required for deployment
- ✅ **0 Serious violations** - Required for production
- ⚠️ **< 5 Moderate violations** - Should be addressed
- ℹ️ **Minor violations** - Tracked for future improvement

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Initial Accessibility Audit

```bash
npm run test:a11y:ui
```

Review any violations and prioritize fixes:
1. Fix all **Critical** violations first
2. Fix all **Serious** violations before production
3. Track **Moderate** and **Minor** for future sprints

### 2. Add to CI Pipeline

Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include accessibility tests in your CI pipeline.

### 3. Regular Testing

Run accessibility tests:
- ✅ Before each PR
- ✅ After UI changes
- ✅ Weekly scheduled scans
- ✅ Before production deployments

### 4. Manual Testing

Automated tests catch ~50-60% of issues. Also test with:
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast mode
- 200% zoom
